    <h2>Storyline</h2>
    <p>
        Two hours from 17:00 to 19:00h on the longest day of the year in the life
        of a young Parisienne is presented.
        Cléo, a singer and hypochondriac,
        becomes increasingly worried that she might have cancer
        while awaiting test results from her doctor.
        However, she values her beauty above all else including health.
        Throughout the film, she grapples with the fear of losing her looks and
        the constant pressure to maintain her appearance in the public eye.
    </p>

    <h2>A stunning scene</h2>

        <img src="image/cleo2.png">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
            "I always thought everyone was looking at me while I didn't see anyone except myself."
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Cléo walks down the street,
        and we see a rush of images at the same time as she does,
        some in her memory, some before her eyes. She recalls Bob, her handsome lover, who doesn't pay much attention of
        her,
        and, in ominous close-up, the face of the woman who read Tarot cards for her at the start of the film.
        She also passes women in housedresses carrying loaves of bread home for dinner.
        Everyone in this scene are staring at Cléo.
        They beautifully evoke the overload of Cléo's thoughts.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, a common trope for Varda.
        On a deeper level, Cléo from 5 to 7 confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision.
        She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections
        and Cléo's ability to strip her body of<a class="sub" href="gaze.html"><u>"to-be-looked-at"</u></a>attributes
        (such as clothing or wigs).
