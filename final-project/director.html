    Agnès Varda (30 May 1928 - 29 March 2019) was a Belgian-born French film director,
    screenwriter, photographer, and artist.
    Her pioneering work was central to the development
    of the widely influential French New Wave film movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
    Her films focused on achieving documentary realism, addressing women's issues,
    and other social commentary, with a distinctive experimental style.

    one of her most notable narrative films, <span>Vagabond</span> (1985), and <span>Kung Fu Master</span> (1988).
