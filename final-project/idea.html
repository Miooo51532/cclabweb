  <h1>Ideas on this project</h1>
  <p>
    Having watched the film <span>Cléo from 5 to 7</span> at West Bund Museum, 
    I am impressed by how much Cléo cares about her beauty and worries about others' gaze.<br>
    Cléo's situation is still so true 60 years after the film was finished
    as I can see many of my friends and I are more or less struggling with it.

    In the p5js sketch, the instruction says to try to escape from the eyes. 
    However, the eyes are generated according to the user's eyes' positions and attracted to the face, 
    so there is actually no way to escape.
