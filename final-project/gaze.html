    <h1>What is Gaze?</h1>

    <p>
        The “gaze” is a term that describes how viewers engage with visual media.
        Originating in film theory and criticism in the 1970s, the gaze refers to how we look at visual representations.
        These include advertisements, television programs and cinema.
    </p>
    <p>
        When film critics talk about the gaze, they are often referring to the “male gaze”.
        The “male gaze” invokes the sexual politics of the gaze and
        suggests a sexualised way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women.
        In the male gaze, woman is visually positioned as an “object” of heterosexual male desire.
        Her feelings, thoughts and her own sexual drives are less important than her being “framed” by male desire.
    </p>

    <h2> Where did this idea come from?</h2>

    <p>
        This key idea of feminist film theory, the concept of the male gaze was introduced
        by scholar and filmmaker Laura Mulvey in her now famous 1975 essay, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual media that respond to masculine voyeurism tends to sexualise women for a male viewer.
        As Mulvey wrote, women are characterised by their “to-be-looked-at-ness” in cinema. Woman is “spectacle”,
        and man is “the bearer of the look”.
